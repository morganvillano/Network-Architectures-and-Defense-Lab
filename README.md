# Network-Architectures-and-Defense-Lab


*** The lab was a group Project, I will only post my part of the project due to plagiarism ***

Essentially, this lab was giving a perfect example of many different parts within the network infastructure. Our main focus was on utility companies vulnerabilities, and proposals to secure and defend the networks and applications they use. 

This lab will provide a deep understanding of application vulnerabilities especially the "green Button". 

The network topology was made to give a example of where the application "The Green Button", was originated from and how it gets distributed to each client.
